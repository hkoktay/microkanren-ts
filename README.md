# Microkanren implementation in typescript

This is an implementation of [microkanren](https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren) based on Jasen Hemann and Daniel P. Friedmanns microkanren implementation and paper. This implementation is a little more verbose because of the abstractions for logic Variables and the State, Substitution and Stream data structures. In the scheme implementation these were implemented with cons pairs and lists.
